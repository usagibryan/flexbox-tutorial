# Flexbox

This is a friendly tutorial that I followed for modern CSS layouts by [Interneting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/). It helped me become more familiar with Flexbox and it's features. It was included in the Additional Resources section of the Foundations course of the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
