# Flexbox

This is a friendly tutorial for modern CSS layouts by [Interneting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/). I followed this tutorial because it was included in the Additional Resources section of the Foundations course of the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
